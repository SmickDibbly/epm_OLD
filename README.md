# Electric Pentacle Machine
This is an attempt to "make a game from scratch": to create a game engine, a graphics library for the game engine, an editor for making game assets, and an actual game. In its current form there is no clear separation between these things, but it resembles an editor most of all.

# What *is* it?
When I was a kid I liked playing around in Unreal Editor 2.0, making bad modifications to the good maps that came with Unreal Tournament (1999). I didn't understand most of the tools in the editor but I could make box shaped rooms, cylinders, stairs, and I could place lights at random places until it looked okay. I could copy a tutorial and learn nothing from it. What was BSP? What was CSG? What was "ambient occlusion"? Lightmaps? Pathnodes? "Extrude to bevel"? It all seemed impossibe to comprehend. Twenty years later I still don't understand most of these concepts, but now I am prepared to learn. And what better way to learn than to create? 



As of May 11, 2023, this is just a dump of (most of) the project directory. I will gradually be cleaning it all up, organizing, writing better comments, etc.
